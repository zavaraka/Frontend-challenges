## My process

I started creating the html skeleton which i closed in a flex-container.
I continued working on css. i started by making the font features for each element. I adjusted the width of the image.
I continued with styling each class starting from the container. I adjusted the position, the margin and the color.
Then i continued with the card.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some Html elements like container and did some practice on divs </h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;

}
```
```
```

### Continued development

I need to learn better to organise the items in a container plus i need to practice flexbox more. I got a better understanding of margins and padding but im struggling with width/ max-width.
Still trying to figure out media query and how to make my project responsive.
My diffuculty is when im in narrow screen and i make the screen wider(between 800 and 1100px wide) its not responsive. On desktop and narrow(mobile) looks okay but not in between.
I tried some commands but didn't figure it out.
